## Vignette Abstract
This vignette focuses on disscussing the difference between three regularization  method: LASSO, Ridge and Elastic Net. A dataset from WTO, containing life expectancy and other 19 variables collecting around the world, is used to fit penalized regression models. 


## Repository Contents

-   `scripts` contains :

    -   `vignette-script.R` an empty script file for you to copy and paste the example code 
    -   `drafts` a folder contains all the example code

One resource to look at are the sections on penalized regression approaches in Dr. Andrea Bellavia's book â€œStatistical methods for Environmental Mixtures," covering the three approaches we went over.

For a programming implementation in R, the following link compares the three different model conceptually and goes over the code:
